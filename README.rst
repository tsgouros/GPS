Graphical Processing Stream
=======================================================

This ensemble of Matlab programs provides an interactive framework for the processing of MEG/EEG data. It uses `Freesurfer <http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/>`_ and `MNE <http://martinos.org/mne>`_. Make sure you have both packages installed and properly instantiated before running GPS: Analysis.

For the purposes of this quick guide, I based it mostly off of `mne-python's git page <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python>`_

See the `GPS home page <https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/software/gps>`_
for documentation, including a cookbook. In this repo, there is a
gps-implementation manual with notes about how it all fits together.

You probably want the 'testing' branch, which works and contains bugfixes.
